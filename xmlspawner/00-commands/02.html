<span class="header102"> <b> <u> [IMPORTSPAWNERS <FILENAME> </b> </u> <br> <br>
Restores distro spawners from 'Saves/Spawners/filename'. 
		Note -- this command does not check for duplication, so if you 
			run it more than once you will end up with multiple spawners.
	These spawns can also be imported back in as XmlSpawners by using the '[xmlimportspawners filename' command.

[WHATISIT
Reports the type and name of the target. This can be used by players or staff to provide information needed to set up quest objectives or any other situation where knowing the type and name of an object is needed.
