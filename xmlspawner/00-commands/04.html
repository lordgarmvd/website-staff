[QUESTLOG
Can be executed by players to bring up the quest log gump. The quest log gump contains a list of all completed and currently active quests as well as current point status and ranking. Completed quests will be next available time (helpful for time-limited repeatable quests) as well as the number of times the quest has been repeated. Active quests have an 'Open' button that allows the individual quest gump to be opened. The top quest players ranking can also be opened from the button at the bottom of the gump.
