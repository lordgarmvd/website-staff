<!-- EXPLANATION OF XML SPAWNER RESOURSE -->
If you would like to set up a spawner that can only be activated when a player with certain skills and/or stats comes within range, this is what you can do
 <br> <br>
1) make sure that it is set up for basic proximity triggering (ProximityRange >= 0)
 <br> <br>
2) you can set PlayerTriggerProp to test for whatever property you would like. For example, to test for the value of a skill you would use a string like
skills.lumberjacking.value > 0
 <br> <br>
* * * * NOTE * * * * <br>
That is skills-dot-lumberjacking-dot-value. It is the same property specification that you would use if you were using the [get or [xmlget command
 <br> <br>
* * * * EXAMPLE * * * * <br>
"[get skills.lumberjacking.value" That is a good general diagnostic test for whether you are specifying a prop correctly. Just see what [get or [xmlget returns ([xmlget lets you see all public properties)
 <br> <br>
If you wanted a spawner that would test for the players Karma or Fame, just add a test like
karma > 1000.
 <br> <br>
You can add compound tests, like 
 <br>
skills.spiritspeak.value > 50 & karma < 0 & fame > 2000
 <br> <br>
3) then you can either set the SpawnOnTrigger property to true, or use the min/maxdelay to set the time between triggering and spawning.
 <br> <br>
4) add the spawns that you would like to appear when the player comes into range to the spawner gump.
 <br> <br>
5) Press the 'Respawn' button on the spawner gump and the spawner should be prepared
