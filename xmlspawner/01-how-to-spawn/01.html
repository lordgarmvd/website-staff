<!-- TITLE OF XML SPAWNER RESOURCE -->
<span class="header101">ADD ITEMS TO A SPAWNED MOB OR CONTAINER</span>
 <br> <br> <br>

<!-- EXPLANATION OF XML SPAWNER RESOURSE -->
Just as you can set the properties on newly spawned objects, you can also add items to spawned mobs or containers.
 <br> <br>
The ADD keyword can be used to add items to the pack of a mob or into a container.
The syntax for this keyword is
 <br> <br>
 
<span class="enhanced_text_01"> 
	ADD[,probability]/itemtype
</span> <br> <br>

You can also add items and change their properties at the same time by using the special grouping characters '<' and '>'
 <br> <br>
 
<span class="enhanced_text_01"> 
	ADD[,probability/<itemtype/propertyname/value...>
</span> <br> <br>
 
This will create the item, set the properties on it, and then add the result to the mob or container.
 <br> <br>
For example, to add a piece of armor to a spawned mobs pack you could use a spawn entry like
 <br> <br>
 
<span class="enhanced_text_01">
orc/ADD/plategorget
</span> <br> <br>

To add it to a container is the same thing
 <br> <br>
 
<span class="enhanced_text_01">
metalbox/ADD/plategorget
</span> <br> <br>

To add more than one item, just keep adding more ADD keywords
 <br> <br>
 
<span class="enhanced_text_01">
orc/ADD/plategorget/ADD,0.3/gold,500
</span> <br> <br>

That will add both the gorget and 500 gold pieces, but the gold will only be added 30% of the time (probability of 0.3)
 <br> <br>
To set the hue of the gorget before adding it you would use the grouping brackets like
 <br> <br>
 
<span class="enhanced_text_01">
orc/ADD/<plategorget/hue/500>/ADD/gold,500
</span> <br> <br>

A few things to note here. 
 <br>
1) The 'gold' is created using a constructor that takes a quantity argument (that's what the 500 is). This is possible because the 'gold' item actual has such a constructor defined for its class. Not all objects will have such a constructor available, and conversely, some objects will have other constructors that can take other arguments. You need to look at the documentation for a particular item class to know what is available and what is not.
 <br> <br>
2) if the grouping brackets were not used, then the Hue property would end up being set on the orc, instead of on the plategorget.
